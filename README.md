# Python-Exercises

These exercises come from the course 'Python For Everybody' (PY4E) - https://www.py4e.com - by Dr. Chuck.
The code was written by me except for the ones where the exercise was to modify an existing code (Link to original code is provided).
Explanation for each exercise is provided within each corresponding file.
